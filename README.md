### Gameplay:
    It's wordle, but in processing. You have 6 opportunites to guess a 5-letter word, with over two thousand possibilities. A
    new word is generated each day in DAILY MODE, and you only have 6 chances to guess the right word. In PRACTICE MODE, a
    new word is generated each time PRACTICE MODE is enabled, but results do not get saved. Each time you submit a guess by 
    pressing ENTER, some of your boxes may light up. Green boxes indicate that the character in that box is in the matching 
    spot of the correct answer. Yellow boxes indicates that the character in that box is in the answer, but in a different 
    location. You can remove characters from your current guess using backspace. Using thebuttons at the top right corner of 
    the window, you can toggle on PRACTICE MODE or DAILY MODE, display your statistics for DAILY MODE, toggle on or off 
    HARD MODE, or retry.
