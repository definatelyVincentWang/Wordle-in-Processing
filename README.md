    some of your boxes may light up. Green boxes indicate that the character in that box is the same as the character in the same place of the answer word. 
    Yellow boxes indicates that the character in that box is in the answer word, but in a different spot. Your currently selected box is highlighted in yellow, 
    and you can remove characters from your current guess using backspace. Each time wordle.pde is run, a new random word is generated. You can press SPACE to 
    print the answer to console.
